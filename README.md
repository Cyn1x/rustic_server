## Introduction

### What is it?
Rustic Server is a secure server written in Rust. I originally created this for an assessment at my university.

### What does it do?


### Purpose
I decided to use Rust to build a server as I was interested in the features available in a modern systems programming language. I do not have an issue with C, or C++, as I enjoy using those languages also.
